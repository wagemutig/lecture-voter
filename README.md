Lecture Voter
=============

Makers Academy decided to run a 3 day hackerthon. 

Our team was given the challenge of creating a lecture voting app.

We tackled the problem using JavaScript and Node, with thorough testing in Mocha, Chai and Zombie. 

The app allows users to vote (+/-) while live streaming the collective results in the form of a graph.

You can see the live version on Heroku at [lecture-voter.herokuapp.com]

Participants: Bernard, Ella, Anna and Colin (September cohort)
